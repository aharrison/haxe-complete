This emacs file uses company-mode to automatically complete based on
the "haxe --display" compiler call.

Note that this method has several downsides:

   * It must save the buffer every time it tries to do a completion.

   * It does not support completion-as-you go. If you type foo.bar
     looking for foo.barbaz, you will lose the completion window.

   * The script must override the prefix minimum length for
     company-mode, which might make other company-mode scripts more
     computationally intensive. This could probably be fixed by
     modifying it locally in the minor mode, but I have reached the
     limit of my emacs-fu.

As a special added bonus, this includes fly-make for haXe under
similar conditions. Unfortunately, it will "crash" fly-make mode if
there is an error on a file other than the file your are browsing.
Also, it includes a function redefinition for
flymake-start-syntax-check-process to get around a bug (I think) in
flymake where it fails to take into account passed-in directories.
